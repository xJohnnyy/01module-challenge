# Module 01 Challenge HTML & CSS

## Description

In this module challenge, we reviewed the webpage for the company Horiseon. Upon further investigation of HTML and CSS behind their website, we discovered areas of improvement. We replaced HTML elements, fixed links in the Horiseon webpage, and cleaned up the CSS selectors. The website now contains a better overall flow to help attract future clients.
